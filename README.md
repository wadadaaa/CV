# Hi 👋 I'm Anna Lopatinski

📞 054-943-8102 💼 @wadadaaa

I'm a software developer from Israel 🇮🇱 with 10+ years of experience.

My main language is JavaScript, and sometimes Python, Go or PHP as I specialize in frontend development and full-stack web applications. I've mostly worked in innovative companies because I love solving real-world problems, building products that people actually use, and bringing ideas to life through code.

I'm passionate about creating intuitive user experiences and writing clean, maintainable code. I believe that great software isn't just about what happens under the hood, but also about how it makes people feel when they use it.

I value continuous learning and sharing knowledge with others. Whether it's mentoring at Django Girls workshops or tackling an IRONMAN, I'm always up for a good challenge! 💪

## 🌟 Beyond the Code

**Mentor** @ [Django Girls](https://djangogirls.org/)  
*Empowering women in tech, one workshop at a time*

One of my favorite ways to give back! I love teaching HTML, CSS, and web design fundamentals, then watching students build their very first Django app. The "aha!" moments are absolutely priceless, and I always learn something new from each group. There's nothing quite like seeing someone write their first line of code that actually works!
<br><br>

**IRONMAN 70.3 Finisher** 🏊🏽‍♀️ 🚴🏽‍♀️ 🏃🏽‍♀️  

**Tel Aviv MARATHON 2025** 🏃🏽‍♀️  

Because sometimes you need to challenge yourself outside of debugging sessions. Training taught me so much about breaking down big goals into manageable pieces – surprisingly useful for tackling complex coding projects too! Plus, the mental toughness from endurance sports definitely helps during those long refactoring sessions.
